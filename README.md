# Moon

A simple PWA app that installs on your phone and shows you what the current phase of the moon is.

Moon position is based on a mathematical calculation based on today's date. 

I gave the 'Full Moon' phase equal length to the other phases, as I think it's stupid that the moon is only technically 'full' for an instant. It looks full to humans on Earth for 4 days or so.
